This folder contains two versions of the maxinterface.json file: the modified version, and the original, in respective folders. The modified version is required by the app to enable saving and loading. 

The modified version is to be copy-and-pasted to a specific location (see below), and the original version is included in case the ORIGINAL original version is misplaced. Note that they share the same name, lending to potential confusion. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

Navigate to… 

Sound\ Control.app/Contents/Resources/C74/interfaces/

…and replace the “maxinterface.json” file located in there with the one found in the “Modification” folder that shares the same location as this .txt file.
